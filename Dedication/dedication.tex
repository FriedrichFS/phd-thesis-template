    I would like to dedicate this thesis to my loving parents, whose unwavering support and encouragement have been my anchor and my strength throughout my academic journey. Your love and sacrifices have not gone unnoticed, and this achievement is as much yours as it is mine.
    
    I also extend my sincere gratitude to [Professor's Name], whose invaluable academic guidance and mentorship have profoundly shaped my scholarly development and enriched my research experience. Thank you guiding me through this challenging yet rewarding journey.
